# Nonsense-Generator-Art101
Art 101 Final Project. A Nonsense Generator that takes in a string and spits out art.
A webpage hosted by UCSC that would display my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills as applied to art.
Specifically would take in a string, and mutilate it with various functions as selected by the user.

Worked on together with [@Langasw](https://github.com/Langasw/).
